# RASCAL - Resources for Analyzing Speech in Clinical Aphasiology Labs

RASCAL is a tool designed to facilitate the analysis of speech in clinical aphasiology research. It processes CHAT-formatted (.cha) transcriptions, organizes data into structured tiers, and automates key analytical steps in transcription reliability, CU coding, word counting, and core lexicon analysis.

## Analysis Pipeline

### **BU-TU Conversation Treatment Monologic Narrative Analysis Protocol**

1. **Step 0 (Manual):** Complete transcription for all samples.
2. **Step 1 (RASCAL):**
   - **Input:** Transcriptions (`.cha`), Tiers (`.txt`)
   - **Output:** Transcription reliability files (`.xlsx`, `.cha`), CU coding files
3. **Step 2 (Manual):** CU coding and reliability checks
4. **Step 3 (RASCAL):**
   - **Input:** Transcriptions, CU coding files
   - **Output:** Reliability reports, coding summaries, word count templates
5. **Step 4 (Manual):** Finalize word counts and speaking times
6. **Step 5 (RASCAL):**
   - **Input:** Word counts, speaking times, participant data
   - **Output:** Blind/unblind CU coding summaries, word count reliability, core lexicon analysis

## Try the Web App

You can use RASCAL in your browser â€” no installation required:

ðŸ‘‰ [Launch the RASCAL Web App](https://rascal.streamlit.app/)

---

## Installation

We recommend installing RASCAL into a dedicated virtual environment using Anaconda:

### 1. Create and activate your environment:

```bash
conda create --name rascal_env python=3.9
conda activate rascal_env
```

### 2. Install RASCAL from GitHub:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/nmccloskey/rascal.git@main
```

---

## Setup

To prepare for running RASCAL, complete the following steps:

### 1. Create your working directory:

We recommend creating a fresh project directory where you'll run your analysis.

Example structure:

```plaintext
your_project/
â”œâ”€â”€ config.yaml           # Configuration file (see below)
â””â”€â”€ rascal_data/
    â””â”€â”€ input/            # Place your CHAT (.cha) files and/or Excel data here
                          # (RASCAL will make an output directory)
```

### 2. Provide a `config.yaml` file

This file specifies the directories, coders, reliability settings, and tier structure.

You can download the example config file from the repo or create your own like this:

```yaml
input_dir: rascal_data/input
output_dir: rascal_data/output
reliability_fraction: 0.2
coders:
- '1'
- '2'
- '3'
tiers:
  '*site':
  - AC
  - BU
  - TU
  test:
  - Pre
  - Post
  - Maint
  participantID: site##
  narrative:
  - CATGrandpa
  - BrokenWindow
  - RefusedUmbrella
  - CatRescue
  - BirthdayScene
```

Explanation:

- Keys prefixed with `*` and surrounded by `""` (e.g., `"*site"`) define partition tiers â€” these group files for separate coding and output.

- In this example, separate CU coding files will be generated for each `site` (AC, BU, TU), but not for each `narrative` or `test` value.

- `"participantID": "site##"` enables pattern matching where the participant ID is derived from the site name followed by digits (e.g., AC01, BU23).

## Running the Program

Once installed, RASCAL can be run from any directory using the command-line interface:

```bash
rascal <step>
```

For example, to run the CU analysis step:

```bash
rascal f
```

## Notes

- `.cha` files must be formatted correctly according to CHAT conventions.
- Ensure filenames match tier values as specified in `config.yaml`.
- RASCAL searches values using exact spelling and capitalization.

RASCAL builds on and integrates functionality from two excellent open-source tools which I highly recommend to researchers and clinicians working with language data:

- [**batchalign2**](https://github.com/TalkBank/batchalign2) â€“ Developed by the TalkBank team, batchalign provides a robust backend for automatic speech recognition. RASCAL is designed to function downstream of this system, leveraging its debulletized `.cha` files as input. This integration allows researchers to significantly expedite batch transcription, which without an ASR springboard might bottleneck discourse analysis.

- [**coreLexicon**](https://github.com/rbcavanaugh/coreLexicon) â€“ A web-based interface for Core Lexicon analysis developed by Rob Cavanaugh. RASCAL interfaces with this tool via Selenium to enable batch submission of samples to an otherwise single-sample system. The underlying functionality and analysis methodology are essential to the Core Lexicon scoring components in RASCAL.
